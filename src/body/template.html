	<h3>About</h3>
	<p>
		A personal space for devloping in the full stack. I'm avoiding Bootstrap and other styling helpers in an effort to learn SASS and improve my CSS knowledge overall. I vastly prefer dark-themed pages for reading content, my favorite color is purple, and I suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness#Anomalous_trichromacy">Deuteranomaly</a>.

		This page uses Heroku to run Node and serve up an AnglarJS app. Currently, this is just using Express to serve static content, but I plan on using Node for fun things such as spawning <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/python-shell">python processes</a> to crunch data and <a href="https://github.com/ssangervasi/python-playground">solve puzzles</a>.
